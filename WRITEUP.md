# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

## App Service choosen
## costs - since CMS is lighweight and less computable App Service is cost effective than VM
## scalability - since CMS is lighweight and less computable scalability is not big concern 
## availability - availability is ensured since app service is maintained by Cloud provider

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

## In future if CMS app is not limited to Admin and publically available for number of users scalability needed that time VM would be best option
